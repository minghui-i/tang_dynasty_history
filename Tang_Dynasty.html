    <li> Reorganized an army with experienced soldiers who were more competent to secure the empire from nomadic tribes invasions</li>
</ol>

<h1> The Decline of Tang </h1>

<h3> The decline of Tang also happened during Xuanzong's tenure.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the late stag of Xuanzong's rule, one of the worst decision he had made was when he listened to Lady Wu Hui-fei's, consort of Xuanzong, advice, which was to put Li-Linfu, her family member, to a high government position. The reason why Tang Dynasty was so successful before the decline was because the system of placing
people who were competent for that position rather than family relationships. Therefore, when Xuanzong started putting people to higher position not because of ability but lineage, the whole system of picking people from examination collapsed which marked the start of decline in Tang Dynasty (corruption in government).
Additionally, Xuanzong fell in love with a woman called Yang Guifei (杨贵妃) which will caused Xuanzong to shift his focus from his duties as emperor to enjoying pleasures that the title "emperor" brought. With duties neglected, Li-Lindu and other incompetent officals from the Yang Guifei's family were in charge with the government leaving citizens of Tang Dynasty suffer. </p>

<h1> An Lushan Rebellion</h1>

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/An_Lu_Shan.jpeg" width="600" height="400">

<h2> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Lushan (安禄山) </h2>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The lack of sobriety of Xuanzong helped the rise of An Lushan who ingratiated Xuanzong and gained the position as 3 Jiedushi (a person who served as a military commander for a region) which means the military power he had was nearly 150,000 men. An Lushan saw the corruption in the government and knew that the time has come. On December 16, 755, the famous "An Lushan Rebellion" broke out. The troops that An Lushan hold was experienced because fighting with nomadic tribes for a long time, but the majority of other Tang troops experienced with the peace era and therefore
lack the experience of war. During the early stag of the rebellion, the rebels was like the juggernaut of the history who took Luoyang, the eastern capital, with ease, and An Lushan declared himself as the emperor of the Yan Dynasty (燕). Six months later, the western capital, Chang'an, also fell into the hands of rebels. The fall of Chang'an forced Xuanzong to flee to modern-day Sichuan. During the fleed, Yang Guifei and her family members were executed because Xuanzong realized that the rebellion was due to his mistake. Suzong succeeded the throne after Xuanzong on July 17, 756, and started to fight back previous Tang territories. On January 29, 757, An Lushan was killed by his own son An Qingxu, and An Qingxu succeeded his father and became the new leader of the rebels.
    Being afraid that Tang troops will fight back, An Qingxu knew that he must cut the "blood vessels" of the Tang Dynasty which is the area between Huaihe River and Yangtze River where food and money were supplied to the empire. With this in mind, An Qingxu orderd <strong>Yin Ziqi (尹子奇)</strong> and 130,000 troops to conquer the area. In order to control the area, Suiyang (睢阳) was the first stop. The city of Suiyang was under the command of its governor <strong> Xu Yuan (许远)</strong> and one of the most critical figure during the rebellion <strong> Zhang Xun (张巡)</strong>. Despite the huge disadvantage which was approximately 7,000 people protecting Suiyang and approximately 13,000 troops sieging Suiyang, the morale of people protecting the city never abated as of result of Zhang Xun's excellent leadership.
By using many tactics, Zhang Xun and his troops shattered rebels' dream to take the area between the two rivers by holding rebels at Suiyang for nearly 10 months. Despite Zhang Xun was killed and Suiyang capatured by rebels at the end due to lack of food and supplies (it was said that the troops ate leaf, bark, grass, horses that were used to fight in war, and everything that they can eat), Zhang Xun and his men earned or provided the conditions for counterattacks by other Tang troops because they have protected the "blood vessels" of the empire. If Suiyang was seized for the first placed, the two rivers (Huaihe and Yangtze) and also the cities that were supplying foods and taxes to the government will fall into the control of rebels which will cause disastrous effects because
without two rivers, it will be hard or impossible to transport supplies, and without cities giving taxes and foods to the government, it will be difficult to organize counterattacks. Therefore, it will be a solid claim to say that the Battle of Suiyang was the turning point of the rebellion and Zhang Xun and his men were the bravest people during the rebellion (7,000 against 130,000). Eventually, other Tang troops were able to take back the empire from the rebels because an enormous number of troops and supplies were squandered during the Battle of Suiyang. However, the "An Lushan Rebellion" was the event that sent the Tang Dynasty from its golden age to decline.   </p>

<h1> The Fall of Tang </h1>

<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the late Tang Dynasty, emperors that followed Suzong were considered incompetent with a few exceptions such as Xianzong (宪宗) who united the empire for a short period of time. Most of the emperors during the lat Tang trusted corrupted government officials and only cared about their own interests such as seeking for an immortality life by drinking "elixir of life" which ironically ended their lives sooner. Eventually, another rebellion broke out known as the "Huang Chao Rebellion" devastated Li family's regime. Later during the year of 907, former follower of Huang Chao, <strong> Zhu Wen (朱温）</strong> forced Emperor Ai of Tang, the last emperor of Tang, to abdicate, and established a new dynasty called Liang (梁), marking the end of Tang. The following year, Emperor Ai of Tang was poisoned. </p>
